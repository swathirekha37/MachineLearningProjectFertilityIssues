# MachineLearningProjectFertilityIssues
Predict Fertility of people using Fertility dataset
This project describes about the training and testing data. 
Finding the best fit model using different regression and classification techniques.
Performed accuracy_score testing on Linear regression, logistic regression,SVC,SVM,naive bayes, knn,kmeans,random forest and decision tress.
After performing all the tests we got best accuracy for random forest classification method with 90%.
Hence this model is used for predicting the futuristic data.
